   <p style="font-size:x-large; color:darkred; background-color:darkcyan;width:41%;"> Is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.</p>
    <p style="">It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p><br/>

      The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.<br/><br/>

      The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C).<br/><br/>Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.<br/><br/>
      
      This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.<br/><br/>It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</p>
      <p><b>Q.What are the common built in data types in Python?</b></p>
      <p>The data tpyes already available  in python are called built in data types There are five built in sata types in python.<br/>None Types ----------- does noy contain any values<br/> Numeric Types ----------- int.float.complex.bool.data data types<br/>Sequences ---------- str.bytes.byte.array.lis.tuple.range<br/>Sets ---------- set.frozen set<br/>Mapping</p>
